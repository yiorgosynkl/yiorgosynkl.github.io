Did you know that Bonobos and Chimps are the Closest Relatives to humans? So in a way, we are a modern version of bonobo, trying to communicate with one another and build a better world. So, since you can use the internet to reach this website, well ... probably you are a modern bonobo and thus the **Modern Bonobo Blog** is what you were looking for. Isn't that fascinating?

## about me

My name is Yiorgos Yiannakoulias. 
You can find me online with many names such as yiorgosynkl, giorgosgnkl, modern bonobo, mayad, ... please don't freak out.
I work as a software engineer. 
I also describe myself as a young enterpreuner, a philosopher of life, a can-do guy and a passionate person. 
I have the following qualities:

* I rock a great beard
* I work out, meditate and read books
* I play music, write songs and hang out with friends (and play beer pong with them sometimes)

What else do you need?
