* Tim Ferriss is a [legend](https://youtu.be/Kd06uvinqLI). So many practial tips. Asking crazy questions like "how could I achieve my goal in one quarter instead of 5 years?", "what if I did the opposite for 48 hours?", "what can my enemy teach me?". Derek Sivers "don't be a donkey" (Buridan's ass) (you can do anything but not everything at the same time) and "if info was the answer, all would be billionaires with six packs", "95% vs 100% bike story" (enjoy the ride, 95% is enough work to also make it sustainable). Journaling and meditation. Rick Rubin. Agassi and Shaun White "who cares" mentality to take the pressure away (I'll go to my family, my friends and all will be good no matter the outcome) (I guess other atheletes could have different mentalities, but this chill one is the one I admire myself, and since high achievers use it, it's possible). Parign the ludicrous absurd funny  goal with the big serious goal (to level stress off).
* [Convex Optimisation](https://youtu.be/kV1ru-Inzl4) is so powerful and lately intersting to me, this Stanford lecture is practical and amazing.
