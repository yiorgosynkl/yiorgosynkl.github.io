* Tim Ferriss is a [legend](https://youtu.be/Kd06uvinqLI). So many practial tips. Asking crazy questions like "how could I achieve my goal in one quarter instead of 5 years?", "what if I did the opposite for 48 hours?", "what can my enemy teach me?". Derek Sivers "don't be a donkey" (Buridan's ass) (you can do anything but not everything at the same time) and "if info was the answer, all would be billionaires with six packs", "95% vs 100% bike story" (enjoy the ride, 95% is enough work to also make it sustainable). Journaling and meditation. Rick Rubin. Agassi and Shaun White "who cares" mentality to take the pressure away (I'll go to my family, my friends and all will be good no matter the outcome) (I guess other atheletes could have different mentalities, but this chill one is the one I admire myself, and since high achievers use it, it's possible). Parign the ludicrous absurd funny  goal with the big serious goal (to level stress off). Test the assumptions, experimenting, meta learning. The best teachers want to become obsolete to their students. 
* [Convex Optimisation](https://youtu.be/kV1ru-Inzl4) is so powerful and lately intersting to me, this Stanford lecture is practical and amazing.
* To the point suggestions on [how to be a beast in your 20s and 30s](https://youtu.be/zz_p3nQ7M40) in Modern Wisdom. 
* I am into RL (Reinforcement Learning) lately. Resources to check are [this video](https://youtu.be/JgvyzIkgxF0) and [Andrej Karpathy blog on Pong](https://karpathy.github.io/2016/05/31/rl/).
* Best [sample breakdowns](https://youtu.be/FpaoCUEhZJM) of the last years (from TrackLib).
* Random video of [lawyer on how to defend people that are guilty](https://youtu.be/A4Ncs9gXBAI). It's a good story to sell, the bottom line is "you never know", but he delivers it in a manner more elaborate.
* [VSauce on Your Red vs My Red](https://youtu.be/evQsOFQju08?) and Qualia (the information that cannot be transfered with words, the pure feelings of seeing, feeling cold etc).
