* Tim Ferriss is a [legend](https://youtu.be/Kd06uvinqLI). So many practial tips. Asking crazy questions like "how could I achieve my goal in one quarter instead of 5 years?", "what if I did the opposite for 48 hours?", "what can my enemy teach me?". Derek Sivers "don't be a donkey" (Buridan's ass) (you can do anything but not everything at the same time) and "if info was the answer, all would be billionaires with six packs", "95% vs 100% bike story" (enjoy the ride). Journaling and meditation. 
* [Convex Optimisation](https://youtu.be/kV1ru-Inzl4) is so powerful and lately intersting to me, this Stanford lecture is practical and amazing.
