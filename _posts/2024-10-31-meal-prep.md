Meal preping can save money, time and hopefully be tasty. It needs some momentum to begin, good choice of recipes and ingredients beforehand, some creativity and a system that get better as time goes by (it's part of the learning process).

* [Jeff Nippard](https://youtu.be/8BKbu_s8p1Q):
  * it's not all just eating meat, he eats many times, kinda healthy (he'll use some cottage cheese)
  * big on turkey
  * cottage cheese with crackers
  * beans and minced turkey
  * use ready cut salads (like coleslaw - cabbage and carrot)
  * pickled onion
* [Make Basics and mix and match](https://youtu.be/LzWb_P4lYgA)
  * chicken and salmon in the oven 
  * then vegetables quickly boiled
  * then potatos and sweetpotatoes baked
  * rice as well for the week
  * use ready made sauces to elevate plain foods, more specifically pesto,  
* [Link](https://youtu.be/1vh1RGdvhpo)  
  * turkey, chicken **shredded**, salmon and **shrimps boiled** (nice touch)
  * tacos and beans combined
  * simple salads: cucumber with vinegar, onion and peppers 
* [Ethan's meal prep for diversity](https://youtu.be/ZJe3yL7NHdA)
  * Braising every Sunday
  * Good habits at key points (e.g. early in the day or week) can have great cascade effect. Use gateway fast habits that will lead to good paths down the lines (ideas from Atomic Habits).
  * Flavouring in simple manner, it's faster and allows versatility for the rest of the week.
  * Sriracha, hoisin and maggi to the meat, then cucumber, carrot, pepper and cilantro for Bahn Mi. 
  * Wraps and sandwiches are handy and helpful, check this [wrap Ethan makes](https://youtu.be/A3gQuYPvL1Y)
    * harissa, yogurt, pickled cabbage (kimchi)

* [Ethan organising your kitchen](https://youtu.be/ylh9GnBYhfc)(TODO)
* [Using frozen vegetables, the smart way](https://youtu.be/XlndcLo3j7I?si), Ethan gives great tips
  * Freezer meals, make them, heat the veggies and sauce on a microwave, and you are done.
  * Blanch veggies and through to fridge, optimally use in 2-3 months (up to 8-12 months)!! Best ones are corn, peas, carrots, potatos and sweet potatoes. Also carrot, bell peppers, brocolli. Even spinach and kale could work. This is good for me because I usually use half and let the other half spoil.
* [Meal preping like a restaurant](https://youtu.be/AVO0ifle-OU)
  * Buy ridiculous amount of deli containers, make many satisfying tastes that last for like a month, then mix and match
  * Assembling during the week
* [Raw diet ideas](https://youtu.be/tyN9HldRav4) with Kristina
  * Rainbow wraps, mono eating one fruit (kinda unhealthy to be fair)
  * Using the blender a lot here is important (I like that)
  * Adding more fruits in the salads
  * Kale, shredded cabbage, bell peppers, cucumber, cherry tomatoes, avocado.
  * Cilantro and parsley.

  * Sous Vide is a hack, but his fun
* [Josh Cortis, all around tips for Meal Prep](https://youtu.be/NO-EbXMB4gc)
  * Reducing friction for the healthy option
  * Container essential characteristics: microwave safe, dishwasher safe, freezer friendly and stackable (glass probably better)
  * Skillet (easy to clean, need to take care), Sharp knife, 1 giant cutting board to fit all the sit and a digital scale
  * Great dishes for meal prep: Soup (freezes and reheats easily), Rice with protein/sauce/veggies
  * Bad dishes for meal prep: Breads that get soggy or salads that contain multiple liquids
  * Allow the meals to go to room temprature
  * Freezing foods using vaccum seals
  * Microwave to reheat meals, 1 minute and remix until it's hot enough. Cut similar sized pieces to reheat evenly.

> the ultimate way to live would be to have a chef or restaurant that can cook healthy foods that are hot every day (subscription based to solve the eating problem once and for all). For now it's expensive for me, hopefully at some point.

Top sauces / pastes (mix 1:1 with water to make sauce) to have in the fridge are [Teriyaki](https://www.waitrose.com/ecom/products/cooks-ingredients-teriyaki-sauce/831655-767213-767214), [Harissa](https://www.waitrose.com/ecom/products/cooks-ingredients-rose-harissa-paste/615202-312331-312332), [Chipotle](https://www.waitrose.com/ecom/products/cooks-ingredients-smoky-chipotle-paste/785003-312393-312394), [Thai green Paste](https://www.waitrose.com/ecom/products/cooks-ingredients-thai-green-paste/895590-767333-767334), [White Miso Paste](https://www.waitrose.com/ecom/products/cooks-ingredients-white-miso-paste/668020-672715-672716) (the ingredients **can be stored for 4-6 weeks**, which is essential for a home cook. List is from [Waitrose Cooks' Ingredients](https://www.waitrose.com/ecom/shop/browse/groceries/waitrose_brands/cooks_ingredients)). I would add mustard, chili sauce (like tabasco), sriracha and mayo (unhealthy but essential sometimes).

Other full flavour ingredients that can be stored for a while are kimchi (pickled cabbage), pickled onions/cucumbers, sun dried tomatoes, canned tomatoes (essential for sauces). 

Other sauces/dips that can be made at home (or bought at the supermarket) are pesto, hummus, babaganoush, tzatziki, romesco, avocado sauce, marinara, guacamole, chimichurri, aj√≠ verde, zhoug, shatta.

Healthy snacks for movie nights: edamame, carrots (maybe combine with a sauce from above). And popcorn with simple salt is alo quite healthy. 

More to check:
* kimchi (pickled cabbaged)
* overnight oats
* falafels in airfrier
* my favourite veggies that are diverse: tomatoes, carrots, spinach
* essentials for cooking stuff: salt, pepper, olive oil, lemon, onion, garlic, mustard
* extra essentials ingredients for fast recipes: yogurt, oats / granola, honey, nuts
* healty fruits: strawberries, kiwi, watermelon, blueberries/raspberries, avocado (healthy fats), pomegrande. Also apple, banana, orange, peach, mango, apricot (are ok but maximum one a day).
* rice cooker, air frier, veggie cutters are essential for meal prep (maybe pressure cooker as well)
* noodles stir fry is the king of fast dishes ([Ethan's basic framework](https://youtu.be/2sbsRR2yZ64)) (TODO)
* mediterannian inspired foods for the whole week like lentils, spinach rice, chicken pie
* omeletes and eggs with cut vegetables
* tuna is a good hack (ready to eat, full of protein)
* blender sauces that can be used for everything pasta sauces that are fast and easy (make large portions and eat) 
* for quick healthy snack, I love italian inspired bread, olive oil, cheese and tomatoes
