## dangling reference problem

I had the following thing (simplified version) when doing some tests with an object that contained references (`name&` in `Person`) and a function creating a prepopulated dummy version of an object.

```cpp
// the DANGLING REFERENCE problem
#include <string>
#include <iostream>


struct Person {
    const std::string& name;    // references are evil!!
                                // usually when this is really expensive you think of passing by reference, but now you don't have control of the lifetime!!!
    int age;
};

Person makeDefaultPerson(){
    const std::string& dummy_name = "Bob"; // you create dummy_name here
    int dummy_age = 23;
    return Person{
        .name = dummy_name,
        .age = dummy_age
    };
    // the dummy name is deleted here!! but there is still a reference to this!!
}

int main() {

    const auto p = makeDefaultPerson();
    std::cout << "Person has age " << p.age << std::endl;
    std::cout << "Person has name " << p.name << std::endl; // you are using name that does not exist
    
    return 0;
}
```

The solution to the problem would be to make copies. But sometimes this is expensive.

The most straightforward solution is using shared pointer:
```cpp
// solution with shared pointer!!
#include <string>
#include <iostream>
#include <memory>

struct Person {
    std::shared_ptr<std::string> name; 
    int age;
};

Person makeDefaultPerson(){
    const std::string dummy_name = "Bob";
    // auto dummy_name2 = std::make_shared<std::string>("Bob"); // could also initialise as unique pointer to string from the beginning

    int dummy_age = 23;
    return Person{
        .name = std::make_shared<std::string>(std::move(dummy_name)), // the shared pointer of Person object will increase the reference counter of string "Bob"
            // using move to avoid unnecessary copy!!
        // .name = dummy_name2,
        .age = dummy_age
    };
    // the dummy_name2 shared pointer going out of scope will decrease the shared pointer's reference counter of string "Bob"
    // but the counter is still positive, string "Bob" is still referenced, hence it won't be deleted
}

int main() {

    const auto p = makeDefaultPerson();
    std::cout << "Person has age " << p.age << std::endl;
    std::cout << "Person has name " << *p.name << std::endl;
    
    return 0;
}
```

Having to initialise a variable like `make_shared` is problematic. Because frequently other people wrote the code before me and later down the line I may introduce `shared_ptr`.
The easy way to solve it is to do an unnecessary copy, but sometimes this is really expensive (for large objects).
The smart way to remember is moving the object (and maybe introducing some const conversion magic):



Another solution is using `unique_ptr`. Imo, really unpredictable and unintuitive to use, the benefit is marginal. (it's difficult to pass as arguments to functions, it's difficult to transfer ownership if something is `const`, bad error messages, ...).

```cpp
// solution with unique pointers
#include <string>
#include <iostream>
#include <memory>
#include <utility>

struct Person {
    std::unique_ptr<std::string> name; 
    int age;
};

Person makeDefaultPerson(){
    auto dummy_name = std::make_unique<std::string>("Bob"); // you have to initialise using a smart_pointer
                // otherwise, you are doommed to make an unnecessary copy (or you will have to use weird `movea)
    int dummy_age = 23;
    // std::unique_ptr<std::string> dummy_name2 = std::move(dummy_name);
    return Person{
        .name = std::move(dummy_name), // the shared pointer of Person object will increase the reference counter of string "Bob"
        .age = dummy_age
    };
    // the dummy_name shared pointer going out of scope will decrease the shared pointer's reference counter of string "Bob"
    // but the counter is still positive, string "Bob" is still referenced, hence it won't be deleted
}

int main() {

    const auto p = makeDefaultPerson();
    std::cout << "Person has age " << p.age << std::endl;
    std::cout << "Person has name " << *p.name << std::endl; // you are using name that does not exist
    *p.name = "Tony";
    std::cout << "Person has name " << *p.name << std::endl; // you are using name that does not exist
    
    return 0;
}
```

## unique pointers and transferring ownership, const pointer of T vs pointer of const T

There is a different between `const pointer of T vs pointer of const T`. 
We use so often `const auto&` as a view of a variable in C++, but it needs to be used carefully with pointers.
This example gives the chance to showcase how awful error messages C++ has.

```cpp
#include <string>
#include <iostream>
#include <memory>
#include <utility>


int main() {
    const std::unique_ptr<std::string> cup_s = std::make_unique<std::string>("Ken"); 
    std::cout << "Const unique pointer of string " << *cup_s << std::endl; // you are using name that does not exist
    *cup_s = "Barbie";
    std::cout << "Const unique pointer of string updated to " << *cup_s << std::endl; // you are using name that does not exist
    // cup_s = std::make_unique<std::string>("John"); // ERROR: "discards qualifiers" aka CONSTNESS ERROR (you said it's const, aka it will not change, but now you try to change it)

    std::unique_ptr<const std::string> up_cs = std::make_unique<const std::string>("Ken"); 
    // std::unique_ptr<const std::string> up_cs = std::make_unique<std::string>("Ken"); // Also possible, casting from string to const string is possbile here
    std::cout << "Unique pointer of const string " << *up_cs << std::endl;
    // *up_cs = "Barbie"; // ERROR: "no match for 'operator='", such a bad error message :(
        // it's actually a CONSTNESS ERROR 
    up_cs = std::make_unique<const std::string>("Mary");    
    std::cout << "Unique pointer of const string updated to " << *up_cs << std::endl; 

    auto up_cs2 = std::move(up_cs); // Transferring ownership of unique pointers
    // std::cout << "Unique pointer of const string " << *up_cs << std::endl; // Segmentation Fault aka accessing wrong memory
        // but nobody prohibits you from using this BROKEN unique pointer!!!
    
    // auto up_cs3 = std::move(cup_s); // COMPLIATION ERROR: moving a const pointer fails
        // moving means that you are changing the state of `cup_s`, but that violates CONSTNESS

    return 0;
}
```

## lambdas: declaring them, assigning them to variables etc.

```cpp
#include <string>
#include <iostream>
#include <cassert>
#include <functional>
#include <algorithm>

int getSizeA(const std::string& s){
    return s.size();
}

// you can pass lambda functions as arguments to other functions
int getSumA(int a, const std::string& s, const std::function<int(const std::string&)>& string2num){
    return a + string2num(s);
}

// you can also have a default argument for the function
int getSumB(int a, const std::string& s, 
    const std::function<int(const std::string&)> string2num = std::function{[](const std::string& s) -> int {
        return s.size();
    }}
){
    return a + string2num(s);
}

// in C++20 and forward, you can have auto arguments in functions!!

int main() {
    std::function<int(const std::string&)> getSizeB = [](const std::string& s){
        return s.size();
    };

    // no need to declare the input parameters twice
    // you can also declare the return type with cool syntax
    auto getSizeC = [](const std::string& s) -> int {
        return s.size();
    };

    assert((4 == getSumA(1, "hey", getSizeC)));
    assert((4 == getSumB(1, "hey"))); // using the function with default lambda


    // using a different string2num conversion
    auto getAs = std::function{[](const std::string& s)-> int {
        return std::count_if( s.begin(), s.end(), []( char c ){return c =='A';});
    }};
    assert((10 == getSumB(7, "BANANA", getAs))); 

    // this shows the manual labour you need to do in C++
    // although versatile, it is not expressive out of the box and not concise when writing code


    // More notes:
    // * lambdas are anonymous, you need to assign them to a variable to reference them
    // * you can pass scope variables inside the `[]`, that can be accessed in the body of the function
    // * std::function cannot take defaults. It would be complicated to implement, without particular benefit. default parameters don't make much sense for lambdas, 
    //   as they are short lived, and used for particular reasons. 
    // * however, for a lambda argument, you can also define a default lambda (see above)

    return 0;
}
```

## c++ naming convention with auto

In C++17 and above, it's equivelantly efficient to write the following ([link](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/39536814/c-using-auto-to-declare-classes-as-variables-inside-functions)):
```cpp
Dog obj1{args...};
auto obj2 = Dog{args...};
auto obj2 = Dog(args...); // could also do this

// also 
auto obj3 = std::make_unique<Dog>(args...);
```

Using auto always is generally more consistent. You can avoid problems with weird constructor sytnax.
You should use intellisense to view the types of variables.

## c++: returing references

You can write functions that return references. Remember to pass relevant input as simple reference (not const ref) and to use `auto&` when calling the function. 
In general, `const ref` variables are useful when just viewing an object and simple `ref` functions are used when we need to update member data of the variable. 

> Note that in the functional programming paradigm, we never update an existing object. We alwyas copy, update a field and then reassign. Functions never have side effects to inputs parameters. In the contrary, when passing by `ref` (and not `const ref`) in C++, the user can change whatever he wants, and you just trust that he operates in the correct manner (not corrupting your data, etc).

```cpp
// copy to https://godbolt.org/
#include <string>
#include <iostream>
#include <cassert>

struct Person {
    std::string name;
    int age;
};

struct Deal {
    Person buyer;
    Person seller;
    int amount;
};

Person getBuyer(const Deal& deal){
    return deal.buyer;
}

Person& getBuyerRef(Deal& deal){
    return deal.buyer;
}

int main() {
    // useful way initializing simple structs
    auto p1 = Person{
        .name = "Mike",
        .age = 22
    };

    auto dealA = Deal{
        // .buyer = Person{
        .buyer = {
            .name = "Mike",
            .age = 22
        },
        .seller  = {
            .name = "Bob",
            .age = 25
        },
        .amount = 43
    };

    auto& buyerA = getBuyerRef(dealA);
    // checking references actually are referring to same objects (not just equality)
    assert((&buyerA == &dealA.buyer)); // same Buyer object

    // see this in action
    assert((buyerA.name == dealA.buyer.name));
    buyerA.name = "Mary";
    assert((buyerA.name == dealA.buyer.name)); // both variables changed name

    const auto buyerB = getBuyer(dealA);
    assert((&buyerB != &dealA.buyer)); // different objects

    return 0;
}
```

## python acronyms

[EAFP](https://docs.python.org/3/glossary.html#term-EAFP): Easier to ask for forgiveness than permission. This coding style is assumes the existence of valid keys or attributes and catches exceptions if the assumption proves false. 
[LBYL](https://docs.python.org/3/glossary.html#term-LYBL): Look before you leap. It's the opposite of the previous coding style. This coding style explicitly tests for pre-conditions before making calls or lookups.
[REPL](https://docs.python.org/3/glossary.html#term-REPL): Read-eval-print loop. It's another name for the interactive interpreter shell. [Replit](https://replit.com/) and other tools take the name from it. Originally developed for the LISP language (the mother of functional programming) [according to wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Read%E2%80%93eval%E2%80%93print_loop).


## VScode like a pro

Firstly, with `CMD + SHIFT + P` I can bring the Command Palette and search for all utilities. This is the smartest thing in VSCode.
In Command Palette type `Shortcuts` to view the provided shortcuts. 
You can also view a few cheat sheets before reading below for my personal favourties. 

* I often want to see the implementation of the function i view. In Command Palette type "Go To Implementation" (shortcut: `CMD + Click`)
* I often want to see where the function is called. In Command Palette type "Find All References" (shortcut: `CMD + SHIFT + F12` or `CMD + F12`).
