[EAFP](https://docs.python.org/3/glossary.html#term-EAFP): Easier to ask for forgiveness than permission. This coding style is assumes the existence of valid keys or attributes and catches exceptions if the assumption proves false. 
[LBYL](https://docs.python.org/3/glossary.html#term-LYBL): Look before you leap. It's the opposite of the previous coding style. This coding style explicitly tests for pre-conditions before making calls or lookups.
[REPL](https://docs.python.org/3/glossary.html#term-REPL): Read-eval-print loop. It's another name for the interactive interpreter shell. [Replit](https://replit.com/) and other tools take the name from it. Originally developed for the LISP language (the mother of functional programming) [according to wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Read%E2%80%93eval%E2%80%93print_loop).


## VScode like a pro

Firstly, with `CMD + SHIFT + P` I can bring the Command Palette and search for all utilities. This is the smartest thing in VSCode.
In Command Palette type `Shortcuts` to view the provided shortcuts. 
You can also view a few cheat sheets before reading below for my personal favourties. 

* I often want to see the implementation of the function i view. In Command Palette type "Go To Implementation" (shortcut: `CMD + Click`)
* I often want to see where the function is called. In Command Palette type "Find All References" (shortcut: `CMD + SHIFT + F12` or `CMD + F12`).
