Here are some ideas and resources to cook easy at home for one person. 

## Basics

It is important to get all the nutrietns during every meal. 
I think of having one of the following in every meal:
* protein (meat, fish, lentils or chikpeas, yogurt)
* carbs (bread, rice, pasta, ...)
* vitamins (salads, vegetables, nuts)

## Ideas

## Extras

* Drink tea during the day or coffee (not more than an espresso a day).
