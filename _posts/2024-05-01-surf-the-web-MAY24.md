Some of my favourite resources of the month:
* [Minimum Wage in Greece](https://el.wikipedia.org/wiki/%CE%9A%CE%B1%CF%84%CF%8E%CF%84%CE%B1%CF%84%CE%BF%CF%82_%CE%BC%CE%B9%CF%83%CE%B8%CF%8C%CF%82_%CF%83%CF%84%CE%B7%CE%BD_%CE%95%CE%BB%CE%BB%CE%AC%CE%B4%CE%B1). Check the relevant table and think about how much inflation has risen, how much house prices have risen and how much the wage has risen. What does this mean about society and equality? It's obvious that getting a degree and working nine to five is not sustainable, although many people do it.
* My personal favourite Ali Abdaal on [How to Find a Career You Genuinely Love](https://youtu.be/O3m14PVOq_g)
