* A rebellious ways to run startups [here](https://youtu.be/xL1MOOD5Ox8?si=5lqcgFQua0aqVL6C). Midjourney, craigslist, gumroad. indie hackers (run small startups on your own, 1 each month). With AI, this is the way to live.
* The [Competitive Programmerâ€™s Handbook](https://cses.fi/book/book.pdf). My favourite sites to practice is leetcode and codeforces (with weekly and biweekly competitions).
