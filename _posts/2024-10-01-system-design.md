A good overall guide is the [system design primer](https://github.com/donnemartin/system-design-primer/?tab=readme-ov-file) repo. (tinyurl, ...)
Also [gaurav sev](https://www.youtube.com/@gkcs) has great videos like [horizontal vs vertical scaling](https://youtu.be/xpDnVSmNFX0) (and sharding, ...). This article contains [18 fundamental concepts for system design](https://www.designgurus.io/blog/system-design-interview-fundamentals). The OG book about to go deeper is [DDIA](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/designing-data-intensive-applications/9781491903063/).


## Main concepts

System design contains ideas to solve answer questions. Usually there are different solutions that have different tradeoffs.

> Essentially what we do in programming all the time is transfering data in a nice manner. And to make things for efficient, we use caching and batching. And to make things resusable we try to make nice/smart APIs (but in practice your manager rarely things of that).
> We always think of what happens if a particular piece fails or takes too much time (timeouts, ...).

A list of questions and related important topics to know:
* "what type of database will I use when storing data?" 
    * Relational database (SQL databases)? or store database (NoSQL)? or niche databases (graph, timeseries, vector)?
    * ACID principles
    * Data Partitioning (sharding) (horizontal vs vertical)
    * Database Index
* "what happens if a particular part of the system crashes?" and "what happens when the system goes back up? what data were lost?"
    * Difference between database (disk) and memory (RAM)
    * Persistency of data, losing in memory, picking up from last checkpoint
* "what are common tradeoffs to consider for system design?", "how do I choose between tradeoffs depending on my project?"
    * Performance vs scalability <details><summary><i>(Explanation)</i></summary>If you have a performance problem, your system is slow for a single user. If you have a scalability problem, your system is fast for a single user but slow under heavy load.</details>
    * Latency vs throughput, Availability vs consistency (CAP theorem)
* "in distributed systems, how do I update replicas?"
    * Database Replication for enhancing reliability
    * Availability vs consistency (CAP theorem). Weak vs Eventual vs Strong consistency
* "how can I serve more clients as the traffic for my application gets bigger?" 
    * Horizontal vs Vertical Scaling
    * Load Balancers (Round Robin, Least Connections, IP Hash)
* "How can I increase performance for an existing system?"
    * Cache (Client / CDN / Web Server / Database / Application caching)
    * types of caching (write through / Cache-aside / Write-behind (write-back) / Refresh-ahead )
* "how is the network structured?" 
    * OSI model (7 layers), TCP/IP, UDP, CDN, packages and abstractions
* "how do individual programs (A and B) communicate (e.g. in microservices)? should A wait for B? should A continue? what if B stopped running? what if the network is down (and A cannot send a message)?" 
    * Asynchrous vs Synchronous systems (Message/Task Queues, publish/subscribe)
    * Popular Message Queues (Apache Kafka, RabbitMQ, Redis (not persistant))
    * APIs, clients and servers, timeouts, Push/Pull, Publish/Subscribe, HTTP (Restful APIs), WebSocket, 
    * Microservices vs Monoliths (network calls vs function calls)
* "how do I estimate requirements fast to decide between tradeoffs?"
    * e.g. "amount of users", "request per day", ...
    * Back-of-the-envelope calculations

And then you have all of these in practice:
* "how can I design the system for an app idea? what are individual pieces and how would they communicate? what are the assumptions about users/data/requests/...? what functionalities to a provide to solve the users problem? what will the API/interface be and how does it affect the system design?"

This [video of 1 hour system design](https://youtu.be/iYIjJ7utdDI) explains the main patterns asked in interviews: 
* Contending updates (many writes for the same key, locking the db will make it slow). Optimise with multiple write leaders. Or stream processing and batching writes (therefore less writes and congestion).
* Derived data (keeping datasets in sync).
* Fan out (e.g. sending push notificaiton or news feed updates). Asynchronously doing work instead of sending requests to thousand of destinations. Essentially sink all messages to a log-based message broker (e.g. Kafka) and consumer logic will handle finding the appropriate parties to send. Caveat the "popular message" or "hotkey". Use popular message cache were users poll for these (instead of push notifications going to everybody).
* Proximity Search (find close items in db, e.g Uber, Lyft). Indexing on latitude and longtitude is the naive solution. Better to use geospatial indexing (and sharding because of huge amount of data).
* Job Scheduling: run a series of job (e.g. build a scheduler or youtube saving video in different encodings/resolutions). We don't care where the tasks run, we use in memory message broker and round robin to workers. No time dependency in messages (aka requirement to process messages in order) therefore we do not need a log-based message broker (if a partition worker is slow, the rest of the workers in the partition have to wait for the slow worker, which is inefficient).
* Aggregation: distributed messages need to be aggregated by some key/time (e.g metrics). Naive solution to store in database and run jobs afterwards. The faster solution is stream processing (with log-based message broker) and partitioning based on the aforementioned key (therefore the proper process will be handling all the key data).
* Idempotence: you don't want to see the result more than once (e.g. amazon confirmation emails in orders). Naive solution is Two-phase commit in dbs. The smart solution is using idempotency key, storing a unique ID for each job (e.g save them in DB) (if we see again the same ID, that means we already processed and send the relevant message). If this happens on the consumer (instead of the producer of messages), it's called "fencing".
* Durable data: data that absolutely cannot be lost once written (e.g. financial applications). Synchronous replication is the first solution (guaranteed to propagate writes to all dbs, but if one replica goes down, no writes can be made, so no fault tolerance). Therefore, the practical solution is a distributed consensus algorithm (and using a log that we know persists).

* [scaling dropbox](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PE4gwstWhmc&ab_channel=Stanford)
* [system design is a scam](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKgtPABz9AY), obviously that is true. People design all these stuff throughout years. the answer is hybrid.

As for books
* System Design Interview, by Alex Xu is good for breadth
* Designing data intensive application is for depth (more hardcore)

As for system design patterns when coding (interfaces), [Refactoring Guru](https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns) is popular resource.
