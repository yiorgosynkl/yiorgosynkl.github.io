Some of my favourite resources of the month:
* Learning about geography is always a passion for me. The world, travelling, nations, history, economy and geopolitics. This month I was learning about the longest rivers. Rivers have been the source of drinking water and have played a major role on where important cities are located. This [playlist](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PL1SsGP17-kZXwnc3b8ABu9fy_uWDlZz0j&si=2Qy5ooM9FEJeV4AU) contains great short videos about Danube, Nile, Congo, Niger, Amazon and Dnieper. More about [european rivers](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/major-rivers-of-europe). Main rivers are **Danube**, **Rhine** (starting in the Alps and going through Europe), **Volga**, Dnieper, Don (Russia, Ukraine, ...), Elbe and Oder (starting in Czech Republic), Douro and Tagus (Spain and Portugal), Loire, Rh√¥ne, Seine (France), Po (North Italy), Shannon (Ireland) and Thames (UK and London).
* As for greek geographic resources, [video for rivers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BcYD0PN3l9c&ab_channel=Elef.Ka.productions) and [article](https://www.greenoliver.gr/ta-10-megalytera-potamia-tis-elladas/), [sea waters](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZaIM9ES7C7o&ab_channel=Elef.Ka.productions) and [mountains](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w-KwJkhyDOw&list=PLIGCoPnpopNE7E0m299-27kUVMsgu9bsG&index=6&ab_channel=Elef.Ka.productions).
* Attention economy and social media. At the beginning, these technology where "bicycles for our minds", empowering us to move forward. But nowadays, it's more about "maximizing our time for attention", they work against us. At some point, we used the search bar to search for a video and then stopped. Nowadays, we just open without reason, just to see what will happen. We don't choose when to use the app, the app (and the developers of social media) control when to attract our attention. ([video 1](https://youtu.be/HBRLMoL_vTQ), [video 2](https://youtu.be/JgkvTRz_Alo?si=y-JZKSGj5nBRPt1h), [video 3](https://youtu.be/3E7hkPZ-HTk)).
* [Chamath Palihapitiya at Stanford](https://youtu.be/PMotykw0SIk) on social media, making money to then "not be sell out and impact society".
* [Ray Dalio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ray_Dalio) (who is one of the most famous American investors) has a Youtube channel. And [this video](https://youtu.be/PHe0bXAIuk0?si=z2Np7O4vGZODBoty), which explains the major concepts of economics everybody should, but I believe 99% of people have no clue (interest rates, debts/credit, cycles, ...). He also has more videos about his book called Principles.
