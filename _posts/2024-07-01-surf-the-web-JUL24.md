Some of my favourite resources of the month:
* Learning about geography is always a passion for me. The world, travelling, nations, history, economy and geopolitics. This month I was learning about the longest rivers. Rivers have been the source of drinking water and have played a major role on where important cities are located. This [playlist](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PL1SsGP17-kZXwnc3b8ABu9fy_uWDlZz0j&si=2Qy5ooM9FEJeV4AU) contains great short videos about Danube, Nile, Congo, Niger, Amazon and Dnieper.
