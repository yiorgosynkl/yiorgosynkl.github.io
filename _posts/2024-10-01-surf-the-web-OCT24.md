* My favourite online mentor, Tim Ferriss, with once again a [great video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZDzd8jpGWc&ab_channel=TimFerriss). I'll watch this every afternoon, to remember the lessons, but some key takeaways:
  * Efficacy beats efficiency. Do the right thing. Substance vs method.
  * The magic process for efficay: Wake up, seat with a cup of tea and write 3-5 important things. Ask "if it's the only thing I accomplish today, would I be satisfied?" and "does moving this forward make all the other todos unimportant or easier to knock off later?". Choose one that you answered yes and focus on **only one for today** for an **uninterapted block of time for 2-3 items**. No social media, no procrastination. For 2-3 hours. Deep work. I can hold my lesser behaviours for a that block of time. Just single task. And if it happens, and I procrastinate, gently come back and foucs. It's part of the process. 
  * Successful people are also humans. Tim raised his passive income and made huge deals but also hit the snooze button mutlple times and watched porn. He is not superhuman, he is not always winning, he makes mistakes.
* A rebellious ways to run startups [here](https://youtu.be/xL1MOOD5Ox8?si=5lqcgFQua0aqVL6C). Midjourney, craigslist, gumroad. indie hackers (run small startups on your own, 1 each month). With AI, this is the way to live.
* The [Competitive Programmerâ€™s Handbook](https://cses.fi/book/book.pdf). My favourite sites to practice is leetcode and codeforces (with weekly and biweekly competitions).
