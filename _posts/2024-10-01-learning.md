There are loads of resources and ideas. I will link my favourites and decompose them in simple sentances.


[Becoming good at math is easy, actually](https://youtu.be/brvugRQVDLM)
* Active vs Passive Learning: you would not learn driving a car or bike by just studying traffic rules and physics. You have to actual experience driving/balancing/steering the wheel/looking around. Similarly in math. Look a question, spend time to think on your own for a bit, then solve it or give up when you don't know and see the answer and learn. That's it. Just practice. You do that many times and you become good.
