Some of my favourite resources of the month:
* [CGP Grey With Rock/Paper/Scissors](https://youtu.be/PmWQmZXYd74). Apart for the funness of the project, I admire the intelligence of this guy. He created a graph of multiple videos and each one getting half a million or at least 100K views, all in one day. THis guy is hacking the reccomendation algorithm.
* This reminded me of my other favourite channel, Kurzgesagt. Awesome video on [Change Your Life – One Tiny Step at a Time](https://youtu.be/75d_29QWELk). The wise planner to set routines and triggers smartly and the todler to follow the habits and pursuit happiness. Convince the brain it's not big of a deal, stack up power/knowledge/expertise through time and then turning them into habits.
* Listening to Naval Ravikant podcast episode on [How to get rich without luck](https://nav.al/rich). Really interesting thoughts. He talks about the [4 kinds of luck (relevant blog post)](https://pmarchive.com/luck_and_the_entrepreneur.html).
* [Dmitry Soshnikov YT channel](https://www.youtube.com/@DmitrySoshnikov-education/playlists) covers great concepts about programming, with serious and to the point teaching style. I was interested in LLVMs architecture, but he teaches many evergreen high level important concepts.
* [Forecasting: Principles and Practice](https://otexts.com/fpp3/) is a great free online book for the fundamentals of time series and analysis for forecasting. Written by Rob J Hyndman and George Athanasopoulos, it's an amazing online resource that I used during uni and now revisit.
* [Ali Abdaal with a book review on "The 12 week year"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIv1J5O15To). Most of the time it's an execution problem, not a knowledge problem (e.g. getting in shape). Also, the only tradeoff to become successful is not having comfort, pushing a bit outside of the comfort zone everytime. Two questions to keep as journal prompts are "Where am I allowing the lack of consistent execution to hold me back?" and "Where am I allowing the fear of discomfort to hold me back?". Creating a compelling vision for the future (having something worthwhile to anticipate and strive at the other end) is crucial. It's okay to change the goal and change/recalibrate over time. But it gives clarity. It's not motivating to wonder aimlessly, even though the journey is more important than the destination. Lastly, splitting the year in more managable chuncks of 12 weeks is great (Parkinsons law and deadlines). In this frame, every day matters, rather than having annualised thinking. Acceleartion of progress for sure.
* [The Blue Dot Effect](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.aap8731). Essentially it raises the question "Do we think that a problem persists even when it has become less frequent?". It seems like it, for example life is much more comfortable in comparison to previous decades, yet people are not feeling much happier (obviously we haven't experienced previous decades and centuries in order to actually feel the comparison). It's good to rhave in mind that maybe 'when the “signal” a person is searching for becomes rare, the person naturally responds by broadening his or her definition of the signal'.
* I am really into MOOCs lately, researching many universities. And the best to find free online courses with world class professors are [MIT OpenCourseWare](https://ocw.mit.edu/) and [Stanford Online (many playlists)](https://www.youtube.com/@stanfordonline). Initially got inspired by [this graduate certificate](https://online.stanford.edu/programs/artificial-intelligence-graduate-certificate). You can see so many small clips by lectures even in Instagram (for example, this clip from [NVIDIAs CEO Jen-Hsun Huang](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xn1EsFe7snQ&list=PL22201173A69F18EA&ab_channel=StanfordOnline). The originals are far better, lines need context in order to be understood and small clips cannot offer that.
* [That's AI](https://www.thats-ai.org/), fun resource with small articles on AI. And [Numerai](https://numer.ai/) is a data science game for the stock market that pays money if you come up with smart models!
* Some good resources for LLMs: [Hugging Face NLP course](https://huggingface.co/learn/nlp-course/chapter1/1), [Andrej Katharpy Zero to Hero Course (recreating ChatGPT)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMj-3S1tku0&list=PLAqhIrjkxbuWI23v9cThsA9GvCAUhRvKZ), [Attention is all you need paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762), [ChatGPT whitepaper](https://chatgpt.com/g/g-9HB5jlky9-ai-whitepaper), [3blue1brown Neural Nets course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aircAruvnKk&list=PLZHQObOWTQDNU6R1_67000Dx_ZCJB-3pi), [article with simple explanation and major papers links](https://arstechnica.com/science/2023/07/a-jargon-free-explanation-of-how-ai-large-language-models-work/), [Stanford course CS224N: Natural Language Processing with Deep Learning](https://web.stanford.edu/class/cs224n/).
