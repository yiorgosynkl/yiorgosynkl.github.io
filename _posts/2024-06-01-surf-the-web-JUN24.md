Some of my favourite resources of the month:
* [CGP Grey With Rock/Paper/Scissors](https://youtu.be/PmWQmZXYd74). Apart for the funness of the project, I admire the intelligence of this guy. He created a graph of multiple videos and each one getting half a million or at least 100K views, all in one day. THis guy is hacking the reccomendation algorithm.
* This reminded me of my other favourite channel, Kurzgesagt. Awesome video on [Change Your Life â€“ One Tiny Step at a Time](https://youtu.be/75d_29QWELk). The wise planner to set routines and triggers smartly and the todler to follow the habits and pursuit happiness. Convince the brain it's not big of a deal, stack up power/knowledge/expertise through time and then turning them into habits.
* Listening to Naval Ravikant podcast episode on [How to get rich without luck](https://nav.al/rich). Really interesting thoughts. He talks about the [4 kinds of luck (relevant blog post)](https://pmarchive.com/luck_and_the_entrepreneur.html).
* [Dmitry Soshnikov YT channel](https://www.youtube.com/@DmitrySoshnikov-education/playlists) covers great concepts about programming, with serious and to the point teaching style. I was interested in LLVMs architecture, but he teaches many evergreen high level important concepts.
* [Forecasting: Principles and Practice](https://otexts.com/fpp3/) is a great free online book for the fundamentals of time series and analysis for forecasting. Written by Rob J Hyndman and George Athanasopoulos, it's an amazing online resource that I used during uni and now revisit.
