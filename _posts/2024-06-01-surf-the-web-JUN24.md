Some of my favourite resources of the month:
* [CGP Grey With Rock/Paper/Scissors](https://youtu.be/PmWQmZXYd74). Apart for the funness of the project, I admire the intelligence of this guy. He created a graph of multiple videos and each one getting half a million or at least 100K views, all in one day. THis guy is hacking the reccomendation algorithm.
* This reminded me of my other favourite channel, Kurzgesagt. Awesome video on [Change Your Life â€“ One Tiny Step at a Time](https://youtu.be/75d_29QWELk).
