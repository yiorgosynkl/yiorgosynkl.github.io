Some of my favourite resources of the month:
* [CGP Grey With Rock/Paper/Scissors](https://youtu.be/PmWQmZXYd74). Apart for the funness of the project, I admire the intelligence of this guy. He created a graph of multiple videos and each one getting half a million or at least 100K views, all in one day. THis guy is hacking the reccomendation algorithm.
* This reminded me of my other favourite channel, Kurzgesagt. Awesome video on [Change Your Life â€“ One Tiny Step at a Time](https://youtu.be/75d_29QWELk). The wise planner to set routines and triggers smartly and the todler to follow the habits and pursuit happiness. Convince the brain it's not big of a deal, stack up power/knowledge/expertise through time and then turning them into habits.
* Listening to Naval Ravikant podcast episode on [How to get rich without luck](https://nav.al/rich). Really interesting thoughts. He talks about the [4 kinds of luck (relevant blog post)](https://pmarchive.com/luck_and_the_entrepreneur.html).
* [Dmitry Soshnikov YT channel](https://www.youtube.com/@DmitrySoshnikov-education/playlists) covers great concepts about programming, with serious and to the point teaching style. I was interested in LLVMs architecture, but he teaches many evergreen high level important concepts.
* [Forecasting: Principles and Practice](https://otexts.com/fpp3/) is a great free online book for the fundamentals of time series and analysis for forecasting. Written by Rob J Hyndman and George Athanasopoulos, it's an amazing online resource that I used during uni and now revisit.
* [Ali Abdaal with a book review on "The 12 week year"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIv1J5O15To). Most of the time it's an execution problem, not a knowledge problem (e.g. getting in shape). Also, the only tradeoff to become successful is not having comfort, pushing a bit outside of the comfort zone everytime. Two questions to keep as journal prompts are "Where am I allowing the lack of consistent execution to hold me back?" and "Where am I allowing the fear of discomfort to hold me back?". Creating a compelling vision for the future (having something worthwhile to anticipate and strive at the other end) is crucial. It's okay to change the goal and change/recalibrate over time. But it gives clarity. It's not motivating to wonder aimlessly, even though the journey is more important than the destination. Lastly, splitting the year in more managable chuncks of 12 weeks is great (Parkinsons law and deadlines). In this frame, every day matters, rather than having annualised thinking. Acceleartion of progress for sure.
