Here are resources that are in my backlog for programming purposes mainly.

* [x] [this](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/12600330/pop-back-return-value) stackoverflow post points to [this](http://ptgmedia.pearsoncmg.com/images/020163371x/supplements/Exception_Handling_Article.html) article that explains EXCEPTION HANDLING in C++. in general, exceptions produce more error prone code. Also [this article](https://ptgmedia.pearsoncmg.com/imprint_downloads/informit/aw/meyerscddemo/DEMO/MAGAZINE/SU_FRAME.HTM) is terrific and explains the `pop_back()` and `back()` split for exception safety (" If that copy construction or copy assignment fails, then the Stack has completed its side effect (the top element has been popped off) but the popped value is now lost forever because it never reached its destination (oops). This is bad news. In effect, it means that any version of Pop that is written to return a temporary like this cannot be made completely exception-safe, because even though the function's implementation itself may look technically exception-safe, it forces clients of Stack to write exception-unsafe code. More generally, mutator functions should not return T objects by value.")
